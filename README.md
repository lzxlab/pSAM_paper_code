# Precise prediction of protein subcellulcar localization
Many shuttling proteins transport between different subcellular locations in response to external signals and regulate a broad spectrum of biological processes . This aberrant localization of proteins is often driven by binding to specific molecules that recognize distinct targeting signals. The dynamic nucleocytoplasmic transport process is regulated by the nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES), while mitochondrial and extracellular localization are determined by pre-sequences such as mitochondrial targeting sequence (MT) and signal peptide (SP). In recent years, an increasing number of proteins initially found in one subcellular component have also been observed to localize in other components and perform completely different functions, especially in tumor and disease states. These discoveries further underscore the importance of further investigations on the regulation of protein subcellular localization.
